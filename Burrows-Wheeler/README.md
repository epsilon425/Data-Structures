Burrows-Wheeler  
-How to use the makefile  
-->Makefile "File name"  
--> Sample files are "banana.txt", "banana2.txt", "ghost.txt", "pipi.txt"  
--> Each sample files are text files in increasing order.  
--> The makefile will take in a text file and use BWT.java to out put two files  
--> bwt and bwt-back; bwt is the result of Burrows-Wheeler Transformation  
bwt-back is the reverting back from the Burrows-Wheeler Transformation.    
--> Sample terminal input: make banana, make ghost, and so on  
-Why do this?  
Burrows wheeler technique is a pre-step for many file compressing techniques and  BWT demonstrates the method behind the technique.
