EdgePercolation    
-Creates a simulation for calculating the percentage of an entity percolating  
across edges to the other side.  
-Upon calling EdgePercolation.java the perameters are   
--> java EdgePercolation M N P T: M and N are M*N edges where P is the probability of each edges percolating to the next  while T is the number of times  this simulation will conduct the experiment.  
--> Output will be the (count of succesful percolation) / T
